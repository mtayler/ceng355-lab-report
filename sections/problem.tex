\section{Problem description}
The purpose of this lab is to design an embedded system to create an
open-loop control system, where the position of a potentiometer is
measured and a frequency dependent on the measured resistance, with the
frequency produced through a 555 timer-based circuit. Systems and
components in this lab include embedded programming of an STM32F0
Discovery board, electrical circuit design of the variable-frequency 555
timer-based astable circuit, digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital
converters, and SPI for inter-IC communication between the
microprocessor and the LCD board.
