\section{Problem description}
The purpose of this lab is to design an embedded system to create an
open-loop control system, where the position of a potentiometer is
measured and a frequency dependent on the measured resistance, with the
frequency produced through a 555 timer-based circuit. Systems and
components in this lab include embedded programming of an \gls{stm}
board, and a Freescale Semiconductor project board with
electrical circuit design of the variable-frequency 555 timer-based
astable circuit, digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters, and
\gls{spi} for inter-\gls{ic} communication between the microprocessor
and the \gls{lcd} board; the system was built on an \gls{stm} ARM
platform.
