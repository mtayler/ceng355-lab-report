\section{Design Solution}
The design solution involved dividing the project into parts, including
planning and implementation divisions which were then separated further
to allow even distribution of the work. Information and reference was
primarily found through the reference manuals for both the \gls{stm} and
project board \cite{ref,board}.
\subsection{Planning}
Before beginning the implementation phase, planning was done to
determine who would primarily focus on which parts of the project, and
come up with some broad design ideas.
\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}
Based on experience from the first lab, and personal preference, lab
work was partitioned accordingly. The project was split into the
embedded programming and accessory circuit design/implementation, where
the majority of the embedded programming was assigned to Tayler Mulligan
and the accessory timer circuit to Raymond Bamford. The partitioning was
not strict, with members collaborating where necessary or convenient.

\subsubsection{Technique and Technologies}
Git and GithHub were utilized for the project to provide team access and
syncing between lab computers (see
\url{https://github.com/tamul/ceng355-lab-project}). The source code was
split into three files: \filename{main.c} (see \ref{app:main}), containing the main program;
\filename{analog.c} (see \ref{app:analog}), containing \gls{adc},
\gls{dac}, and frequency monitoring
code; and \filename{lcd.c} (see \ref{app:lcd}), containing code related
to the \gls{lcd}; each with corresponding header files. Each file
provided initialization functions for the components and abstracted
functions to control the components, such as:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
void spi_init(void),
void lcd_cmd(uint8_t data),
void lcd_char(char c),
\end{lstlisting}

etc. in \lstinline{lcd.h}; and:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
void dac_init(void),
void adc_init(void)
uint16_t adc_read(void),
void dac_write(uint16_t),
\end{lstlisting}

etc. in \lstinline{analog.h}. See the attached listings in the
appendices for complete definitions and declarations.

\subsection{Test Procedures}
Tests of the system were conducted in a unit manner: each individual
component was tested before testing components together.

\subsubsection{External PWM Signal Generator}
The \gls{pwm} generator was tested by building up the circuit and
providing a variable voltage through a signal generator's DC supply
function, and the output measured with the oscilloscope to ensure
varying the voltage resulted in a changing frequency.

\subsubsection{Potentiometer and ADC System}
The \gls{adc} and potentiometer was tested by supplying the
potentiometer to the analog input pin PA1 and printing the digitized
analog value to the trace of the \gls{stm}.

\subsubsection{DAC System}
The \gls{dac} system was tested using the \gls{adc} by writing the value
measured by the \gls{adc} to the \gls{dac}'s output register and
measuring the outputted voltage and ensuring it varied with varying
the resistance of the potentiometer.

\subsubsection{LCD System}
Testing the \gls{lcd} was conducted with the other components working,
where the test was simply getting the desired message to print.
Initially that desired message was any symbol appearing on the display;
and after debugging, the frequency and resistance value display.

\subsubsection{Complete System}
To test the complete system, the external 555 timer-based \gls{pwm} signal
generator output was connected to both the \gls{stm} board and oscilloscope
such that the frequencies could be compared. The potentiometer was
varied and the generated \gls{pwm} signal's frequency was measured on
both the oscilloscope and the \gls{stm} board as displayed on the
\gls{lcd}: they were found to coincide. Resistance measurement was
confirmed by linearly varying the potentiometer between either extreme
and ensuring the resistance displayed on the \gls{lcd} linearly varies
between \SI{0}{\ohm} and \SI{5}{\kilo\ohm}.


\subsection{Test Results} The results of testing with the above
specified procedures including range, resolution, and measurement error
were recorded.

\subsubsection{Resistance Measurement}
The measured resistance range was the full range provided by the
potentiometer (\SI{0}{\ohm}). As the range of values available from the
\gls{dac} was that provided by a 12-bit integer (0 to 4095) and the
resistance of the potentiometer varied between 0 and 5000, the
measurement resolution of the potentiometer was slightly over
\SI{1}{\ohm}, $\frac{5000}{4095}\approx1.221$\si{\ohm}. The error in
measurement was less than could be measured with the test setup.

\subsubsection{Frequency Production and Measurement}
The frequency of the resulting \gls{pwm} signal varied between
281-535\si{\hertz} in increments of around \SI{20}{\hertz}, or steps of
approximately \SI{400}{\ohm} of change in the potentiometer. The coarse
resolution was caused The measurement error of the frequency in the
available range was less than \SI{1}{\hertz}.

\subsubsection{Limitations}
The largest limitation of the system was the range of frequency the
design external PWM circuit was capable of producing with the available
voltage range from the \gls{stm} board's analog output pin. Additional
limitations came from the \gls{lcd} display. With the \gls{lcd}'s size
of 8x2 only 4 digit values could be displayed. The severe of
ghosting of the \gls{lcd} also limited the viable update speed: when the
display was updated too quickly the two least significant digits, which
changed the most, tended to blend together and become undecipherable;
this was solved by eliminating the two least significant digits as there
value did not tend to influence the produced frequency, which relied
more on the two most significant digits.
