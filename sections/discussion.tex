\section{Discussion}
The largest factors in the design that was decided upon is the use of
\gls{spi} to greatly simplify the \gls{lcd} interface and an abstracted
hardware interface to allow faster development. Using \gls{spi} reduced
wiring and \gls{gpio} port setup and avoided potential "bit banging", or
sending a series of hard-coded bits reducing flexibility of development
and coordination of parallelizing serialized data. \\

The simple design of the \gls{pwm} signal generator lead to a small
range of producible frequencies with a relatively low resolution. A more
complicated design may have been able to produce a wider range with more
coverage. The trade-off for simplicity over optimization also resulted
in a slower response time than could be achieved with a more complex
design. Placing the \gls{lcd} update code in the frequency monitor
interrupt lead to simplicity with the \gls{lcd} only changing when there
was an update and avoided interrupts being serviced while writing to the
\gls{lcd}, however this also decreased the maximum update rate of the
frequency monitor. This was deemed to be an acceptable trade-off as the
measured frequency wasn't being supplied to another component other than
the \gls{lcd} for human observation and thus the maximum speed
observable was deemed the maximum necessary speed of measurement.
